# Contribution Guidelines

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- **The pull request should have a useful title and include a link to the thing you're submitting and why it should be included.**
- Don't open a Draft / WIP pull request while you work on the guidelines. A pull request should be 100% ready and should adhere to all the guidelines when you open it.
- The project repo should have at least 5 stars.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Boilerplates and templates are usually not accepted as most boilerplates are too opinionated and low-quality and we don't have time to comment on everything they need to improve. Prefer improving and contributing to the official [tact-template](https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-template) instead.
- If you are submitting a closed source tool or contract, include evidence of it being built with Tact. The only exceptions are cases when the authors publicly admitted they used Tact.
- The "Closed Source" section for "Tact in Production" has a very high bar for acceptance. You're a lot more likely to get accepted if you link to a blog post on how you built the tool, Tact contract or system of Tact contracts.
- Submitted open source tools should have an English README, demonstration of the tool in the README (CLI output, screenshots, videos, etc.), and a binary or installation instructions for at least one OS, preferably macOS, Linux and Windows.
- Submitted tools and contracts should be tested and documented.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[title](link) - Description.`
- Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant section.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Try not to mention `Tact` in the description as it's implied, unless it's an important part of the description.
- Try not to start the description with `A` or `An`.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome, but should be done in a separate pull request.

Thank you for your suggestion!

### Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult. If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. If you are not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/docs/blob/master/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
